# so long as the schools are represented across the haul samples in proportion to their relative abundance, 
# the mean across iterations in unbiased, whether weighted or not, and regardless of selectivity shape
#
# you don't need to weight by haul's catch even if the number of samples within a haul aren't proportional to catch
#
# for any given iteration, the composition resulting from weighted or unweighted comps can be different.
#
# the uncertainty around weighted comps is larger than unweighted comps, for all selectivity

# iss for both expansion types < nss (horizontal line), simulation framework is able to produce overdispersion
# will not show nss line in plots unless used to explain results
#
# unweighted iss > wtd iss, wtd iss takes into account additional source of uncertainty in sampling unit total/catch and 
# potential for differing sample size
#
# no significant difference in iss across selectivity shapes, only difference was for multimodal, where iss for uniform
# selex slightly larger than for other selex shapes, will integrate results across selectivity shapes in following results
#
# for both unweighted and weighted expansion types, pop'n unit structure influences magnitude of iss,
# uncertainty in comps with recruitment pulse > multimodel > unimodal
